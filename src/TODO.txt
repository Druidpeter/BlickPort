-- TODO.txt --

1. Rework the codebase so that the game starts at level 1, the level
is properly displayed. And controller input causes the target and
player to move. Just use the target image for both the player and the
target sprite. There's no need to deal with animations quite yet. (COMPLETE)

1.1 create new aux executable to generate player animation.dat
file. Have renderdata factory properly create the renderdata on
request using data loaded from animation file, and insert into player
spawn entity. Check to make sure that the animation runs smoothly and
everything is in order BEFORE trying to set-up player-map collision
logic. (IN PROGRESS)

2. Implement player entry into the map and 2D world physics. Collision
against the map should work well. Still no need for animations.

3. Implement entity entry into the map and basic entity behavior for
the different types of entites: e.g. enemies, items, map switches,
letters. The logic doesn't need to be fully realized at this
stage. Just something to bootstrap off of.

4. Implement transitions between all game stages. E.g. between levels,
menus, and exit conditions.

5. Implement sprite animation system and corresponding animations +
soundbank, et al.

6. Flesh out and prepare to finalize entity behaviour logic.

7. Finalize, apply polish, repeat.
