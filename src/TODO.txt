-- TODO.txt --

Currently working on setting up level traversal. The
map::generateLevelLinks() method currently is implemented such that it
changes two tiles on the map to be of type SIGNPOST.

I still need, however, to do the following:

1. Change map::render() to check for SIGN_POST tile type, and render
the appropriate glyph.

2. Also refactor map::render() so that checking between walkable and
non-walkable tiles is different from checking between the various
different types of non-walkable tiles. (e.g. The current algorithm
just places '#' on non-walkable tiles. We need now to discriminate
between what actual objects can be placed on the map, et al.)

3. Probably also need to audit the tile data bitmaps, export their
defines to a separate header file, and mop up the comments so that a
proper explanation for how map tile types work is available as comment
documentation in said header file. This is pretty important, as the
codebase is starting to get quite sophisticated, now that we're
starting to bootstrap game specific features.
